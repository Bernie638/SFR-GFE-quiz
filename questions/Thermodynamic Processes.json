    "question": "Refer to the drawing of two 1,000 ft3 pressure vessels with installed relief valves (see figure below).\nBoth vessels are in saturated conditions at 281\u00b0F and approximately 35 psig. Vessel X is\ncompletely filled with saturated water. Vessel Y contains one-half saturated steam (100 percent\nquality) and one-half saturated water (0 percent quality) by volume. Both vessels are protected by\nidentical relief valves.\nIf both relief valves begin to leak at a rate of 0.1 percent of design flow, the higher temperature fluid\nwill initially be leaving the relief valve of vessel _____. And, if 100 lbm of fluid is released\nthrough both relief valves, the larger pressure decrease will occur in vessel _____.\n-842-\nPWR Test Items",
