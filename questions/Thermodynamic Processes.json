    "stem": " Refer to the drawing of two 1,000 ft3 pressure vessels with installed relief valves (see figure below). Both vessels are in saturated conditions at 281\u00b0F and approximately 35 psig. Vessel X is completely filled with saturated water. Vessel Y contains one-half saturated steam (100 percent quality) and one-half saturated water (0 percent quality) by volume. Both vessels are protected by identical relief valves. If both relief valves begin to leak at a rate of 0.1 percent of design flow, the higher temperature fluid will initially be leaving the relief valve of vessel _____. And, if 100 lbm of fluid is released through both relief valves, the larger pressure decrease will occur in vessel _____. NRC Generic Fundamentals Examination Question Bank--PWR November 2020",
