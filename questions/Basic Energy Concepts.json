      "A": "The enthalpy of the water at point A is smaller, because some of the water\u2019s kinetic energy is converted to enthalpy as it flows to point B.",
      "B": "The enthalpy of the water at point A is greater, because some of the water\u2019s enthalpy is converted to potential energy as it flows to point B.",
